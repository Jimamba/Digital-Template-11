<h2>Blue Square vs. Red Circle</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
It's a boss battle between the player and a red circle.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to enjoy the fight as if it were a boss battle in a much bigger game.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Boss Battle Plat-former.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can move up, left, and right using the arrow keys. They can fire using the F key,
with their shots coming out a bit delayed. The Red Circle can fire shots back, however it's shots are not limited to just its
body. The shots fire from multiple heights depending on the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Boss Battles. I wanted to put in more attacks, but ran into trouble with killing them after a certain time
has passed.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The bullets the boss fires are created using the player's height rather than the boss' height.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is a blue square fighting a red circle.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
How will win and how will lose in this battle between geometric shapes? Only you can decide.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like plat-formers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Approximately a minute and a half.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't stay on one floor, swap between both.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
